Airz23's Stories, on an Interactive Bookshelf
================

_A different way to view the great stories of Airz23 (reddit), a personal project in which I stopped working on months ago_

I created this as a fun project, just as a test to see if I could take what I saw in this demo
(http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/08/3d-book-showcase/) and turn it into something more. I really liked the end product,
but it has some major draw backs, since creating this project months ago it appears it no longer renders the back side of the
front cover when the book is open, must be an update to Chrome. It looks like a horribly garbled mess in FF and doesn't work -
at all - in IE.
