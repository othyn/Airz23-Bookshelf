Airz23's Stories, on an Interactive Bookshelf
---

_A different way to view the great stories of Airz23 (reddit), although currently not rendering the rear page of the books, unfortunately_

I created this as a fun project, just as a test to see if I could take what I saw in this demo
(http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/08/3d-book-showcase/) and turn it into something more. I really liked the end product,
but it has some major draw backs, since creating this project months ago it appears it no longer renders the back side of the
front cover when the book is open, it looks although it's pointing toward an update to Chrome in the last few months. It looks like a horribly garbled mess in FF and doesn't work - at all - in IE; but that was known on the start with the book animation template stating so.
